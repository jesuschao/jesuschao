### Data Analytics | Python | SQL | Power BI | Machine Learning || Executive MBA | Industrial Engineer

Hi there 👋. I am a well rounded professional with good balance in technical skills and business knowledge. My experience as 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫 has allowed me developed an analytical mindset and focused on problem resolution. I am a good team-worker with capability to manage client and provide creative solutions. I reckon the data is playing an ever more critical role in decision making: it is here where I want to provide added value. I am a non-conformist with great capacity for learning and with creative character.

#### Extra work.

I would like to bring up another project which is very different from previous mentioned. This work was done in collaboration and its purpose is building up a startup project from zero. A B2B platform that connects users and tattoo artists and create a community. Revenue of this company comes from several services offered to the artists.
